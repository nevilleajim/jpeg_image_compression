INFO: [Project 1-571] Translating synthesized netlist
WARNING: [Netlist 29-101] Netlist 'top_level' is not ideal for floorplanning, since the cellview 'top_level' contains a large number of primitives.  Please consider enabling hierarchy in synthesis if you want to do floorplanning.

WARNING: [Constraints 18-5210] No constraints selected for write.
Resolution: This message can indicate that there are no constraints for the design, or it can indicate that the used_in flags are set such that the constraints are ignored. This later case is used when running synth_design to not write synthesis constraints to the resulting checkpoint. Instead, project constraints are read when the synthesized design is opened.
